            Dana Barrett:
            <br>
            (in an inhuman demonic voice)
            <br>
            "There is no Dana, only Zuul!"
            <br>

            <br>
            Mayor:

            <br>
            Dr. Ray Stantz:

            "What he means is Old testament, Mr. Mayor, real wrath of God type stuff."
            <br>
            <br>
            Dr. Peter Venkman:

            <br>

            Winston Zeddemore:
            <br>
            "The dead rising from the grave!"
            <br>
            <br>
            Dr. Peter Venkman:
            <br>
            "Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together...mass hysteria!"
            <br>
            <br>
            Mayor:
            <br>
            "All right, all right! I get the point!"
        </p>
        <h3>Scene 3</h3>
        <p>
            (clearing away tables in the dining room to make room for the ghost trap)
            <br>
            <br>
            Dr. Ray Stantz:
            <br>
            "I've gotta get this in the clear...!"
            <br>
            <br>
            Dr. Peter Venkman:
            <br>
            "Wait, wait, wait! I've always wanted to do this..."
            <br>
            <br>
            (he yanks a tablecloth off of a table, overturning and shattering everything
            <br>
            except the centerpiece in the middle)
            <br>
            <br>
            Dr. Peter Venkman:
            <br>
            (triumphantly)
            <br>
            And the flowers are still standing!
