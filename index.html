    <li>Dylan Desmarais, Communication Design, Junior</li>
    <li>I am a Communication Design major with a focus in Illustration, and as such am required to take this class. However, I mostly do digital art, and do not have much experience with website and interface design.</li>
    <li>I have no prior experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
    <li>I hope to learn how to use code to design an interface.</li>
    <li>A screen has many different sizes depending on what device the viewer is on. A designer will need to take all of these sizes into consideration.</li>
    <li>https://www.clarityincrazy.com/cbd The bright colors, and cutesy characters make for a pleasing viewing experience.</li>
    <li>https://www.dopplepress.com The paper texture and bright colors beautifully communicates the idea that this website deals with printing of some sort.</li>
    <li>https://www.pokemon.com/us/ The website is extremely easy to navigate, with anything people might want being available on the front page.</li>
