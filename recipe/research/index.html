            <li>2 pounds (12 to 15 per pound) shrimp in the shell</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons good olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry white wine</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons minced garlic (4 cloves)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup minced shallots</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary leaves</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 extra-large egg yolk</li>
            <li>2/3 cup panko (japanese dried bread flakes)</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Peel, devein, and butterfly the shrimp, leaving the tails on. Place the shrimp in a mixing bowl and toss gently with the olive oil, wine, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Allow to sit at room temperature while you make the butter and garlic mixture.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mash the softened butter with the garlic, shallots, parsley, rosemary, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, lemon juice, egg yolk, panko, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper until combined.</li>
            <li>Starting from the outer edge of a 14-inch oval gratin dish, arrange the shrimp in a single layer cut side down with the tails curling up and towards the center of the dish. Pour the remaining marinade over the shrimp. Spread the butter mixture evenly over the shrimp. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until hot and bubbly. If you like the top browned, place under a broiler for 1 minute. Serve with lemon wedges.</li>

                <p>Food Network does a good job of keeping the recipe simple and easy to read. The ingredients are on the left, and the instructions are on the right. At the very top the website even links a video on how to make the dish.</p>

                <p>NY Times Cooking has a nice description at the beginning that tells the reader what they should be expecting. This is promptly followed by the ingredients and instructions. However, the instructions re only 2 steps, when I feel like it would make more sense to split it into more steps. This way each step isn't as bloated.</p>

                <p>The design of Bon Appetit is very clean and easy to read. There is a very simple progression from description, to ingredients, to preparation. My only complaint with this website is that the bottom of the webpage kind of disapears to make way for an ad. It just feels kind of awkward.</p>
