        <h1>Watching you</h1>
        <h2>Rodney Atkins</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Driving through town just my boy and me</p>
        <p>With a happy meal in his booster seat</p>
        <p>Knowing that he couldn't have the toy</p>
        <p>'Till his nuggets were gone</p>
        <br>
        <p>Green traffic light turned straight to red</p>
        <p>I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath</p>
        <p>His fries went a flying and mumbled under my breath</p>
        <p>Well then my four year old said a four letter word</p>
        <p>That started with "s" and I was concerned</p>
        <p>So I said son now where did you learn to talk like that</p>
        <br>
        <p>He said I've been watching up dad, ain't that cool</p>
        <p>I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you</p>
        <p>And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are</p>
        <p>We got cowboy boots and camo pants</p>
        <p>Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad</p>
        <p>I wanna do everything you do</p>
        <p>So I've been watching you</p>
        <br>
        <p>We got back home and I went to the barn</p>
        <p>I bowed my head and I prayed real hard</p>
        <p>Said lord please help me help my stupid self</p>
        <p>Then this side of bedtime later that night</p>
        <p>Turning on my son's scooby doo nightlight</p>
        <p>He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees</p>
        <p>He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands</p>
        <p>And spoke to God like he was talking to a friend</p>
        <p>And I said son now where'd you learn to pray like that</p>
        <br>
        <p>He said I've been watching up dad, ain't that cool</p>
        <p>I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you</p>
        <p>And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are</p>
        <p>We like fixing things and holding mama's hand</p>
        <p>Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad</p>
        <p>I wanna do everything you do</p>
        <p>So I've been watching you</p>
        <br>
        <p>With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug</p>
        <p>Said my little bear is growing up</p>
        <p>And he said but when I'm big I'll still know what to do</p>
        <br>
        <p>He said I've been watching up dad, ain't that cool</p>
        <p>I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you</p>
        <p>And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are</p>
        <p>By then I'll be as strong as superman</p>
        <p>We'll be just alike, hey won't we dad</p>
        <p>When I can do everything you do</p>
        <p>Cause I've been watching you</p>
